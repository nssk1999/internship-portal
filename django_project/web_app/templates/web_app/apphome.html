                    An internship is on-the-job training for many professional jobs, similar to
                     an apprenticeship, more often taken up by college and university students during his
                     undergraduate or master degree in their free time to supplement their formal education
                     and expose them to the world of work. </p>
                <p style="text-indent: 500 px;">Employers too benefit from an internship arrangement as it gives access to interns
                     with some skills to execute relevant tasks for the employer. Many interns end up with
                     permanent service with the same organisation in which they are interned. Their worth to
                     the organisation may be greater than before by the fact that they require modest or less
                     training.</p>
